### Recurrent Neural Networks

CNNs can efficiently process spatial information, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed to better handle sequential information. RNNs introduce state variables to store past
information, together with the current inputs, to determine the current outputs.

Here is on example of supervised RNN.
